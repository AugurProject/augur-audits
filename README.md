# keythereum-audit

## TO-DO

@jack

* Missing PR for `encrypt` 3.1.3 feedback
* Any additonal content to add to the "General Findings" sections? Most of the PR's were empty - tried to fill as much as I could in. 
* Any general comments / overall feedback given by anyone expect Gustav?
* Would we like to seperate these by "low/medium/high" risk, or is detailed and general sufficent segmentation?

@tom

* PGP sign audit report w/ Foundations key when complete
* ~~Check all links work~~
* ~~Add authors section with their contact infomation~~
* Make public repo in Augur `audit-reports` (?) that will contain all post-mortems?
