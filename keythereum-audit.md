## <a id="heading-1.2"/> About Keythereum

The primary repository for [Keythereum](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum) can be found in the [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs) team repository on GitHub.

> Keythereum is a JavaScript tool to generate, import and export Ethereum keys. This provides a simple way to use the same account locally and in web wallets. It can be used for verifiable cold storage wallets.

Keythereum uses the same key derivation functions (PBKDF2-SHA256 or scrypt), symmetric ciphers (AES-128-CTR or AES-128-CBC), and message authentication codes as geth. You can export your generated key to file, copy it to your data directory's keystore, and immediately start using it in your local Ethereum client.

# <a id="heading-2"/> Overview

## <a id="heading-2.1"/>Source Code

The ENS source code is publicly available in the `keythereum/master` branch of the Keythereum Github
repository.

## <a id="heading-3.1"/> Detailed Findings

Outlined below are detailed findings of the Keythereum audit: 

--------------------------------------------------

### <a id="heading-3.1.1"/> `str2buf`

Auditor: [Maciej Hirsz](github.com/maciejhirsz) and [Krill Fomichev](https://github.com/fanatid)

Pull Request: [PR #25](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum/pull/25)

```js
// convert string to buffer
function str2buf(str, enc) {
  if (str.constructor === String) {
    if (enc) {
      str = new Buffer(str, enc);
    } else {
      if (validator.isHexadecimal(str)) {
        str = new Buffer(str, "hex");
      } else if (validator.isBase64(str)) {
        str = new Buffer(str, "base64");
      } else {
        str = new Buffer(str);
      }
    }
  }
  return str;
}
```
#### No fast-fail mechanism: 

The function will only process Strings, and otherwise return any value passed unchanged. If I misuse the function and do something along the lines of:

```js
const notAString = 5;

doSomethingWithABuffer(str2buf(notAString));
```

I will, hopefully, get an exception that something is amiss down in the guts of `doSomethingWithABuffer`. The problem here is that the actual error - passing a number where a string was expected - isn't detected until much later in the execution of the program. Any situation where the execution continues while operating on erroneous data is far worse than throwing an error. An informative error here would helping the developer using the function find the fault at the level where it occurs in shorter time.

In case a situation where a `Buffer` is passed into the function should be allowed, and that `Buffer` should then be returned unchanged, such a situation should be handled explicitly.

#### Potential correctness issues when the format isn't easy to deduct:

Consider a string `deadbeef` - is it a buffer serialized as hexadecimal or base64? Turns out, it can be either. The probability of a situation where a buffer is encoded as base64 and then incorrectly parsed as hexadecimal is insanely low for buffers of any reasonable length (32 bytes for private keys should virtually be unaffected), yet still - a chance of an error equal to 0 would be preferable.

This might be good for the end user who has to deal with the implementation, but the checks made are completely unnecessary in the inner-workings of the library where the encoding is (should be) known beforehand, more on that later.

#### No unit tests:

This is a pure function, which is a unit test heaven. It's however not exposed in the API, and thus not tested.

--------------------------------------------------

### <a id="heading-3.1.2"/> `hex2utf16le`

Auditor: [Maciej Hirsz](github.com/maciejhirsz) and [Krill Fomichev](https://github.com/fanatid)

Pull Request: [PR #26](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum/pull/26)

```js
// convert hex to UTF-16LE
function hex2utf16le(input) {
  var i, l;
  var output = "";
  for (i = 0, l = input.length; i < l; i += 4) {
    output += "\\u" + input.slice(i+2, i+4) + input.slice(i, i+2);
  }
  return JSON.parse("\"" + output + "\"");
}
```

#### Naming:

First of all, the name of the function (and the comment above it) doesn't accurately describe what the function does. What I would expect a product of the function to be is a buffer representing unicode text as binary utf16 little-endian buffer. This is not what this function does. It's taking a hex-encoded utf16le binary buffer as input and produces a JavaScript `String` (which is incidentally stored as UTF-16, with endianess depending on the hardware). A more fitting name would be a variation of `utf16leHex2str`, although I'd suggest changing it entirely to `utf16le2str`, accepting `Buffer` type as input and, optionally, converting `String` inputs to buffers with `hex` being the assumed encoding.

#### No fast-fail mechanism:

This function only works if the supplied input is not just a hexadecimal representation of a buffer, but also that buffer has to have length dividable by 2 (or in case of the hexadecimal string - 4). Should that constraint be violated, the conversion happily continues until it crashes at `JSON.parse` with an `uninformative unexpected` token exception. This has actually happened to me as I was trying to put Keythereum into a web worker, and didn't correctly serialize and deserialize a private key buffer (on a much higher level API) to be passed through as JSON message between processes. A quick check if the length of the input is divisible would at least partially remedy that situation.

#### Implementation details:

Using `JSON.parse` here, while being a workable solution, seems like a misuse to me. JavaScript exposes an API for converting UTF-16 charcodes to characters via `String.fromCharCode`, using which would likely result in a better performance on top of making the intent clearer.

#### No unit tests:

Again, a pure function that is critical to the correctness, it should be unit-tested.

--------------------------------------------------

### <a id="heading-3.1.3"/> `encrypt`

Auditor: [Maciej Hirsz](github.com/maciejhirsz)

```js
  /**
   * Symmetric private key encryption using secret (derived) key.
   * @param {buffer|string} plaintext Text to be encrypted.
   * @param {buffer|string} key Secret key.
   * @param {buffer|string} iv Initialization vector.
   * @param {string=} algo Encryption algorithm (default: constants.cipher).
   * @return {string} Base64 encrypted text.
   */
  encrypt: function (plaintext, key, iv, algo) {
    var cipher, ciphertext;

    if (plaintext.constructor === String) plaintext = str2buf(plaintext);
    if (key.constructor === String) key = str2buf(key);
    if (iv.constructor === String) iv = str2buf(iv);

    cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algo || this.constants.cipher, key, iv);
    ciphertext = cipher.update(plaintext.toString("hex"), "hex", "base64");

    return ciphertext + cipher.final("base64");
  },
 ```
 
#### Input and output encoding:

Kind of following on `str2buf` issues described above. `plaintext` is described as "Text to be encrypted". The correct description should be "Data to be encrypted". The use of the word "text" would suggest that I can safely pass any JavaScript string and have it encrypted, however I have no guarantee how that encryption will proceed, will my text be converted to a buffer using a base64, hexadecimal or a utf8 codec?

What if my input is intended to be base64 encoded, but I made an error somewhere in my own code and my base64 is malformatted - I should get an error when trying to use such malformatted input, but instead my input can be converted a buffer as UTF-8 (or worse, hexadecimal), producing an incorrect result.

An option that would be idiomatic to Node.js' `crypto` module would be to allow the consumer of the API to define the encoding of the input as well as the output (more on that later). On the same note, instead of always returning a base64 encoded string, returning a `Buffer` by default, with an option to convert it to a String would be beneficial (or skipping that step altogether and delegating the user to use `.toString(encoding)`).

#### Unnecessary encoding and decoding back to back:

This is not the only function where it happens, but it is the first one - `cipher.update` handles `Buffers` by default, `plaintext` is already converted to a `Buffer`, encoding it as a hexadecimal string only to have it parsed back to a Buffer is completely unnecessary.

#### Concatenating base64 strings is unsafe:

This function will produce correct results only if the first part of `ciphertext` is encoded without base64 padding - that is, if the length of the buffer encoded to base64 is divisible by 3 (every subsequent 3 bytes can be tightly encoded as 4 base64 bytes without padding).

**Example:** ASCII `"fooba"` encoded to base64 produces `"Zm9vYmE="`. ASCII `"r"` encoded to base64 produces `"cg=="`.The concatenated product is thus `"Zm9vYmE=cg=="`, which is different from when ASCII `"foobar"` is concatenated before encoding, producing `"Zm9vYmFy"` (notice lack of padding since length is divisble by 3 here).

The results should be concatenated as buffers using `Buffer.concat`, and only then encoded, if necessary.

--------------------------------------------------

## <a id="heading-3.2"/> General Findings

### <a id="heading-3.2.1"/> `deriveKey` silently fails for empty passwords

Auditor: [Maciej Hirsz](github.com/maciejhirsz)

Pull Request: [PR #19](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum/issues/19)

`deriveKey` internally performs a `if (password && salt)` before proceeding. This works fine for most scenarios, but will fail when `password` is an empty string (which should still be a valid use case).

Additionally when it does fail, it does not throw an informative exception, it just returns undefined and tends to cause a confusing error somewhere down the line (calling `slice` of `undefined` and what not).

**Suggested tweaks:**

* Change the password check to `password != null` or `typeof password === 'string'`.

* When either `password` or `salt` are missing, throw an exception.

>Looks good, can’t find anything wrong on first pass through code. Maybe worth double checking by running tests also against these fixtures – if padding always works, e.g. if a generated key is less than 32 bytes (I’m guessing this would have been caught by the exhaustive tests though).
